MENTOR NAME : Neela Santhosh Kumar

DESCRIPTION : File handling is a crucial concept in programming that enables efficient storage, retrieval, modification, and management of data. As part of this internship task, you are required to develop a File Handling Utility using Eclipse IDE, a widely used integrated development environment for Java and other programming languages. The utility should allow users to perform various file operations, such as creating, reading, writing, appending, searching, and deleting files.

This project will help you gain hands-on experience in file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), exception handling, and Eclipse IDE usage. It will also provide an opportunity to apply best coding practices while working with real-world file operations.

Recommended Functionalities:

File Creation: A function to create new files if they do not exist.

File Reading: A function to read and display content from files.

File Writing: A function that writes data to files, with options to overwrite or append.

File Deletion: A function to delete unnecessary files safely.
